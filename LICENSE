      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Commercial Sale Notification Requirement.

      Prior to the commercial sale, distribution for a fee, or any form of
      monetization of any Derivative Work based on this Work, You must notify
      the original creator(s) of the Work (whether individual(s) or company)
      in writing. Such notification must include:

      (a) A description of the Derivative Work and its intended use;
      (b) The anticipated date of commercial release or sale;
      (c) Contact information for the party intending to commercialize
          the Derivative Work.

      Notification must be sent via one of the following methods:

      (a) Postal mail to the physical address specified by the copyright
          holder(s) in the NOTICE file or other documentation;
      (b) Email to the email address specified by the copyright holder(s)
          in the NOTICE file or other documentation;
      (c) Any other communication method explicitly authorized in writing
          by the copyright holder(s).

      If no contact information is provided in the NOTICE file or other
      documentation accompanying the Work, You must make reasonable efforts
      to contact the copyright holder(s) identified in the Work using
      publicly available contact information. Notification is not considered
      complete until confirmation of receipt is obtained from the copyright
      holder(s), or until 30 days have passed since sending via postal mail
      with proof of mailing (such as certified mail or equivalent).

      This notification requirement is for informational purposes only and
      does not require approval, consent, or any response from the original
      creator(s). Failure to provide such notification prior to commercial
      sale constitutes a breach of this License.

      For the purposes of this section, "commercial sale" includes but is
      not limited to: selling copies of the Derivative Work, offering the
      Derivative Work as a paid service, including the Derivative Work in
      a product or service sold for profit, or any other arrangement where
      monetary compensation is received in exchange for access to or use of
      the Derivative Work.

   7. Prohibition of Illicit Use.

      The Work and any Derivative Works may not be used for any unlawful,
      illegal, or illicit purpose. You agree not to use the Work or any
      Derivative Work:

      (a) In violation of any applicable local, state, national, or
          international law, statute, regulation, or ordinance;
      (b) To promote, facilitate, or engage in any criminal activity;
      (c) To infringe upon the rights of others, including but not limited
          to intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or contractual
          rights;
      (d) To harass, abuse, threaten, or harm any individual or group;
      (e) To distribute malware, viruses, or other malicious code;
      (f) To engage in fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, or
          other financial crimes;
      (g) To circumvent sanctions or export control laws;
      (h) For any purpose that would bring the Licensor or Contributors
          into disrepute or associate them with illegal activities.

      Any use of the Work or Derivative Works in violation of this section
      shall immediately and automatically terminate all rights granted
      under this License. The Licensor reserves the right to pursue any
      and all legal remedies against parties who use the Work or Derivative
      Works for illicit purposes.

   8. AI and Machine Learning Training Prohibition.

      Unless expressly authorized in writing by the Licensor, You may not
      use the Work or any Derivative Works, in whole or in part, to:

      (a) Train, develop, or improve any artificial intelligence, machine
          learning, deep learning, or neural network model or system;
      (b) Create training datasets, corpora, or data collections for use
          in machine learning or AI development;
      (c) Fine-tune, adapt, or otherwise modify pre-existing AI or ML
          models using the Work;
      (d) Generate synthetic data based on patterns learned from the Work;
      (e) Build or enhance any automated content generation system,
          including but not limited to large language models, image
          generators, or code synthesis tools.

      This restriction applies regardless of whether the AI/ML training
      is performed directly by You or by a third party on Your behalf.
      Any authorization for AI/ML use must be obtained separately in
      writing from the Licensor and may be subject to additional terms
      and fees.

   9. Ethical Use Requirements.

      You agree to use the Work and any Derivative Works only in a manner
      that is ethical and socially responsible. Without limiting the
      generality of the foregoing, You shall not use the Work or any
      Derivative Work:

      (a) In any manner that causes or contributes to environmental
          degradation, pollution, or destruction of natural habitats;
      (b) To facilitate or enable human rights violations, including but
          not limited to forced labor, human trafficking, or suppression
          of free speech;
      (c) For mass surveillance, unauthorized tracking, or monitoring of
          individuals without their informed consent;
      (d) To develop or deploy autonomous weapons systems or other
          technologies designed to harm human life without meaningful
          human control;

          content;
      (g) To exploit or endanger children in any way.

      The Licensor reserves the right to terminate this License immediately
      upon discovery of any use that violates these ethical requirements.

   10. Enhanced Attribution Requirements.

      In addition to any attribution requirements set forth elsewhere in
      this License, You must provide clear and conspicuous attribution
      to the original creator(s) in the following manner:

      (a) Source Code: All source files must retain the original copyright
          notice and include a reference to this License;

      the name(s) of the original creator(s), and a link to the original
      source repository or website (if available).

   11. Non-Endorsement.

      Nothing in this License shall be construed as granting You any right
      to claim or imply that:

      (a) The Licensor or any Contributor endorses You, Your organization,
          or Your products or services;
      (b) The Licensor or any Contributor is affiliated with or sponsors

      You must include a prominent disclaimer in any Derivative Work
      stating that it is not endorsed by, affiliated with, or sponsored
      by the original creator(s) of the Work, unless You have obtained
      explicit written permission to state otherwise.

   12. NO TRADEMARK RIGHTS GRANTED.

      THIS LICENSE EXPLICITLY DOES NOT GRANT ANY RIGHTS TO USE THE TRADE
      NAMES, TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS, LOGOS, OR PRODUCT NAMES OF THE
      LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR. No implied license or right is granted
      under this License to use any trademark, trade name, service mark,
      or logo of the Licensor or any Contributor, whether by estoppel,
      implication, or otherwise.

      You may not use any trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos,
      or product names of the Licensor or any Contributor:

      The only permitted use of the Licensor's name is as required for
      reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work
      and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file, if any.

   13. NO WARRANTY.

      THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
      OR IMPLIED. THIS LICENSE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
      INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

      (a) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY;
      (b) WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE;
      (c) WARRANTIES OF TITLE;
      (d) WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT;
      (e) WARRANTIES THAT THE WORK WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED,
          OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS;
      (f) WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE

      THE LICENSOR AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
      WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, SECURITY, OR
      SUITABILITY OF THE WORK FOR ANY PURPOSE. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE
      RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK.

      You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
      using or redistributing the Work and assume any and all risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   14. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
      WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
      UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW (SUCH AS DELIBERATE AND GROSSLY
      NEGLIGENT ACTS) OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE
      LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A
      RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
      WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
      OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES), EVEN IF SUCH CONTRIBUTOR
      HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   15. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   16. Indemnification.

      You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor and
      all Contributors, and their respective officers, directors, employees,
      agents, successors, and assigns (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties")
      from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities,
      costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court
      costs) arising out of or relating to:

      (a) Your use of the Work or any Derivative Work;
      (b) Any Derivative Work You create, distribute, or make available;
      (c) Your violation of any term or condition of this License;
      (d) Your violation of any applicable law, regulation, or third-party
          right (including intellectual property rights and privacy rights);
      (e) Any claim that Your Derivative Work infringes or misappropriates
          any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other
          intellectual property right of any third party;
      (f) Any claim arising from end users or customers of Your products
          or services that incorporate the Work or Derivative Works.

      This indemnification obligation shall survive the termination or
      expiration of this License and shall apply regardless of the form
      of action, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise.

      The Indemnified Parties reserve the right, at Your expense, to assume
      the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which You are
      required to indemnify them, and You agree to cooperate with the
      defense of such claims. You shall not settle any claim without the
      prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Parties.

   17. No Waiver.

      The failure of the Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any
      provision of this License shall not constitute a waiver of such
      provision or the right to enforce it at a later time. No waiver
      of any term or condition of this License shall be effective unless
      made in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver
      is sought to be enforced.

      Any waiver of a breach of any provision of this License shall not
      be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or
      any other provision. The rights and remedies provided in this
      License are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
      provided by law.
